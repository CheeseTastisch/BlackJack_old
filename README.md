# BlackJack
Read the black jack rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

If you want to play, just run the `main` function in the `Boot.kt` file.

## Input
On the bottom of the current display there is always some information on
what you can do next.

## Output
Please note, that the special characters for the colors of the cards (♠, ♣, ♥, ♦) are sometimes
not displayed correctly on windows. Just use linux or macOs and it should work,
or just ignore it, as it is not important for black jack anyway.
